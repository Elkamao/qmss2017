Data Set Information
"This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature.  Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other."

Dataset is comprised of 4 variables and 1 class variable (species) measured in 150 iris flowers. The data is stored in one CSV, iris.csv, and contains the following columns:
* pepal length (cm)
* pepal width (cm)
* petal length (cm)
* petal width (cm)
* species: type of flower (Iris-Setosa, Iris-Versicolour, Iris-Virginica)
