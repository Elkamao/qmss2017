Wine Quality Dataset

Data Set Information:
"The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.). These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are munch more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods."

Dataset is comprised of 11 features and 1 outcome variable (quality) measured in 1599 red wines and 4899 white wines. The data is stored in two CSVs, winequality-red.csv and winequality-white.csv, and contains the following columns:
* fixed acidity 
* volatile acidity 
* citric acid 
* residual sugar 
* chlorides 
* free sulfur dioxide 
* total sulfur dioxide 
* density 
* pH 
* sulphates 
* alcohol 
* quality (score between 0 and 10)
