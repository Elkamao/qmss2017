Data Set Information
"This dataset from the UCLA Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics focused on understanding the dimensional structure of memory and cognitive control (response inhibition) functions in both healthy individuals (130 subjects) and individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia (50 subjects), bipolar disorder (49 subjects), and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (43 subjects). The dataset includes an extensive set of assessments (for a full list, see: https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2016110/tables/3)."

This dataset is comprised of self-report questionnaire and behavioral data collected from healthy individuals (130 subjects) and individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia (50 subjects), bipolar disorder (49 subjects), and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (43 subjects). Participants of the study completed an extensive battery of neuropsychological testing. The tutorial data only focuses on a fraction of the total available data. The tutorial dataset is organized in a single CSV file, symptoms.csv, and its corresponding metadata is stored in a second CSV file, symptoms_metadata.csv.
